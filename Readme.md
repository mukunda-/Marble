**Marbles** is a timer app for [*deep work*](https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/).

There are different ways to perform deep work. One of the popular methods is the Pomodoro technique, where you do 30-minute time blocks – 25 minutes of focusing on a single task, and 5 minutes of rest to review your progress and prepare for the next time block. You do four of these before a longer break to give your brain a rest.

You can try different intervals; everyone works differently. Some people avoid rest periods altogether during work. I do a loose Pomodoro where I focus on single tasks to completion during a sprint period, and then do casual work and check what my colleagues are up to during a rest period.

Why is it called Marbles? [Andy Tryba likes to use marbles](https://medium.com/@andy.tryba/how-10-marbles-became-my-most-important-work-from-home-productivity-tool-e19f34a61995-tool-e19f34a61995) – one marble per 30 minutes of work, and the goal is 10 marbles a day.
