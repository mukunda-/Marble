**Marbles** is a timer app for *deep work* based on the Pomodoro technique.

The standard time block for deep work is 30 minutes – 25 minutes for focusing on a single task, and 5 minutes of rest to review your progress and prepare for the next time block. Everyone has different brains, so you might use different intervals.

It's recommended to do four of these mini-sprints and then take a break; that is, a two-hour block total before working casually for some time, giving your brain a longer rest.
